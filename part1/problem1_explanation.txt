In order to synchronize the pirates and ninjas entering and exiting the dressing room, we used semaphores. Using a semaphore allowed us to have multiple pirates or multiple ninjas enter the dressing room by having multiple locks. Our solution maximizes profits while not depriving one side or the other of the costume department by having a semaphore that acts as a FIFO queue. In this way, requests get serviced in the order they come. However, there is one exception. To maximize the utilization of the teams (and the profit), instead of setting the initial value of the queue semaphore to 1, it is set to half the number of teams. In this way, every time a thread requests priority, it may be competing against another thread that does not have priority but may be a member of the same team (and thus can enter immediately). This means that a thread has a better chance of getting in if it belongs to the same team that currently occupies the store, thus increasing parallelism. However, fairness will still exist because eventually the queue will be serviced.

***
Analysis of synchronization scheme in this specific run:
1. 20 total threads are created, 10 are pirates and the other 10 are ninjas.
2. Thread 15 (a ninja), requests the priority lock and succeeds. Because it has possesion of the priority lock, it is able to acquire the ninja lock, pirate lock, and team lock. Having these three locks bars the other team (the pirates) from entering the costuming department and only allows members of their team to enter. Once the ninjas acquire these three locks, they let go of the priority lock.
3. Next, Thread 10 also tries to enter the dressing room and succeeds because it is also a ninja and the ninja lock, pirate lock, and team lock has already been acquired by the ninja team.
4. Thread 10 leaves the department and Thread 15 follows out, letting go of all three locks.
5. Once the priority lock was let go by the ninjas, the pirates immediately requested the priority lock. While the ninjas were in the costuming department, the pirates were just waiting for their turn. Requesting the priority lock means that whenever the team that you are waiting for has released it (the ninjas), you (the pirates) automatically get possesion of the ninja lock, pirate lock, and team lock. The priority lock maintains fairness, as one team will not be starved of the costuming department. The cycle continues from here.
