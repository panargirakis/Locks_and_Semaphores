Analysis of synchronization scheme in this specific run:
1. 20 total threads are created, 10 are pirates and the other 10 are ninjas.
2. Thread 6 (a pirate), attempts to acquire the pirate lock and succeeds as no other thread has acquired it. Thus, it is able to enter the dressing room.
3. Next, Thread 7 also tries to enter the dressing room and succeeds because it is also a pirate and the pirate lock has already been acquired.
4.
