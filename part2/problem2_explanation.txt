Phase 1: Assume that the Minnesotan drivers follow the convention that whoever arrives at the intersection first proceeds first. Using the language of synchronization primitives, describe the way this intersection is controlled. In what ways is this method suboptimal?

Answer: This intersection is controlled in a way such that, if a car arrives to the intersection first, it is allowed to proceed first
This method is suboptimal because only one car can go at a time since only one is allowed in the intersection at one time. In reality, two cars could take right or left turns at the same time and not crash, but not using this method.

Phase 2: The governor allows the Massachusetts drivers to return and sends the Minnesotans back home. Assume these drivers do not follow the convention described above. In particular, Massachusetts drivers are happy to enter an intersection, even if only the front bumper of their car will fit. In what instances can this mindset produce a deadlock? (It will be helpful to think of this in terms of the model we are using instead of trying to visualize an actual intersection). How can such a deadlock be prevented?

Answer: This mindset can produce a deadlock because if one car decides that there is enough room for their front bumper of their car to fit, then 

A deadlock like this can be prevented if
